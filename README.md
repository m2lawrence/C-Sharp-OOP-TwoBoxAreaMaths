# C-Sharp-OOP-TwoBoxAreaMaths
//Creating multiple instances of a class, which have their own member function() and variables.

Box Box1 = new Box(); //class, object, =new class method, builds the new object Box1 from the Box object.

Also later on I use the NEW keyword when calling my Methods to make a new object and override all the methods in it. This uses Inheritance and Polymorphism.

Polymorphism is:
Running loads of Methods() in different objects at the same time, and being able to change its form.
